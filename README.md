# PersonalWebsite
My website that I programmed just using HTML and CSS. It is linked [here](https://lukedischiave.neocities.org). 

I have several buttons that link to my YouTube, Twitch, MK64.com page, and Discord. 

I also have my Mario Kart 64 time trials timesheets listed, which simply contain my personal best times for each respective console and mode.

## Datapath 
Contains my experience and documentation surrounding a Datapath Vision-E1 capture card. Orginally produced for the professional market, it was designed to display a nearly-lossless analog RGB video or digital video feed. I document how I was able to capture high-fidelity video from my Nintendo 64 using one of these devices.

## NTSC
These are my personal best times on an American/Japanese Nintendo N64 console, which is referred to as NTSC. It links to a page with an embedded Google sheet containing all my times, which includes extra information such as the link to the video, the date I achieved the time, and my personal subjective rating of how good the time was. Using CSS, I styled it so that non-shortcut is in the upper pane and shortcut is in the bottom pane. I used the flex property to achieve this. You can toggle between 3lap and fast-lap times at the bottom of each pane.

Styles are stored in NTSC/styles

## PAL
These are my personal best times on a European Nintendo 64 console, which is referred to as PAL. Like NTSC before it, it links to a page containing the same embedded Google Doc with all the same information within. It is styled the same way as NTSC. 

Styles are stored in PAL/styles

## icons
Contains all the icons that I used for my social media buttons

## styles
The styles for the main page are stored here. There's a block for each social media icon. When you hover your cursor over them, they slightly enlarge and your cursor turns into a thumb. They link to my social media accounts to each respective platform. 

## index.html
Contains the hyperlinks to my directories and my social media buttons. There's also a link to my best non-shortcut times that I achieved in Grand Prix 150cc. It links to a website that contains the items I used, the date of the time, the rank, and any comments that I had.

## neocities.png
The neocities logo

## not_found.html
This is shown when the user tries to access a directory that does not exist. It's simply text that tells the user that the page was not found.
